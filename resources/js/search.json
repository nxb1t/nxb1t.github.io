Each block contains a piece of the file. The first block usually contains the metadata for the file. When we delete a file, only the first block which contains metadata is deleted. The operating system can no longer detect the file because it's metadata is lost hence considers the blocks free for writing new file. Recovery tools read the storage sectors one by one, block by block, and find correlated blocks. Once all the correlated blocks are found, the recovery utilities remake the metadata. Since the blocks are marked free, there is a high chance of blocks getting overwritten by new files, hence the recovered files might have the contents of an already existing file. So, It is highly recommended to recover file as quickly as possible to prevent overwriting.","For most of the users, Autopsy would be enough to recover the deleted files as it includes the tools listed below, selecting all the files in Deleted Files category and exporting it to the desired folder will do the job.
