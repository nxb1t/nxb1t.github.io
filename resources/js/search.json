Debates have arisen around Rust's speed, with some arguing that it is faster than C/C++. Notably, Rust has also been used to write kernel drivers for the Linux kernel, which previously only supported C and Assembly code. Furthermore, many popular command-line tools for Linux have been re-implemented in Rust. One such example is the well-known bat tool, a clone of cat with syntax highlighting and other features. These made me wonder why is Rust so popular? and how effective it would be for Offensive Purposes.","In this article, we will analyse some malicious Rust binaries and check their behavior against Windows Defender.","Please note, this post is for educational purpose only. All the malware samples are created using the codes taken from OffensiveRust GitHub repository."]},{"i":"why-rust-so-special","l":"Why Rust So Special?","p":["Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.","It is fast as C and C++ or sometimes even better.","It is LLVM based.","Easy to cross-compile.","The main reason for its offensive capabilities is the LLVM toolchain, which makes it easier to bypass static analyzers."]},{"l":"Overview Of Rust Binaries","p":["Before testing the Malware Samples, Let's look at a simple calculator program in Rust."]},{"l":"Creating a Rust Project","p":["cargo init rust_calc","Cargo.toml is the config file for cargo package manager.

The resulting executable will be found under the target\\release\\ directory. Here is the IDA disassembly of the both builds, they are almost same and both include function symbols.","cargo run to run the debug build.","Debug (unoptimized)","Debug Build","Function symbols expose so many informations in static analysis, so it should be stripped for better AV evasion. Fortunately, we just need to add a single line in Cargo.toml for stripping function symbols.","Here is the size of different build variants with default optimization.","IDA view of stripped Rust executable","Release (optimized + non-stripped)","Release (optimized + stripped)","Release Build","Size"]},{"l":"Testing Malware Samples","p":["In this section, we are going to test the classic Process Injection technique. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges - MITRE T1055","There are many samples with different types of techniques in OffensiveRust github repo, testing them all will make this blog super lengthy. For now, let's test the Local Process Injection and Remote Process Injection samples."]},{"l":"Local Process Injection","p":["Change the shellcode memory permission/protection to Read Execute using VirtualProtect","Copy the shellcode to allocated memory","Create a new Thread using CreateThread with the base address pointing to shellcode memory","Create Thread","Finally call WaitForSingleObject to keep the thread running infinitely","Finally the function casting exec_data eliminates the need for using Windows APIs calls like CreateThread etc.","Finding the correct function in IDA was a bit of annoying, but we can see the shellcode and all other function calls there.","IDA view of CreateThread","Let's do another test, this time using Windows APIs.","link_section specifies the section to use for a function or static, in our sample the shellcode is saved in the .text section and As a result, no need to create any RWX memory for our shellcode.","Local Process Injection - CreateThread Workflow :-","Local Process Injection - Shellcode Local Inject Workflow :-","Shellcode in .text section, starts at offset 0xcb6 and ends at offset 0xdc9","Shellcode Local Inject","Source : OffensiveRust - Process Injection Create Thread","Source : OffensiveRust - Shellcode_Local_Inject","That's all for Local Process Injection, to make things even harder we can use several types of obfuscations on strings and shellcodes, hide the Windows API function traces by manually implementing them and so on. litcrypt crate is an example for string obfuscation.","The no_mangle macro disables symbol name encoding, mangling is the encoding of function and variable names into unique names so that linkers can separate common names in the language. Disabling it is essential for unsafe C codes to access the shellcode.","This is the most basic process injection, saving shellcode in the .text section of the program and execute it without any API calls.","This sample really impressed me, same shellcode but this time shellcode is in stack memory. Literally no detection, the power of Rust obfuscation is really visible here. Windows Defender static analysis were easily defeated.","VirtualAlloc allocates memory for shellcode with Read Write Permission on the current process","Windows Defender easily caught our sample the moment it touched the disk, No wonder because we are putting plain metasploit shellcode in the .text section. Metasploit shellcodes are highly signatured, so its pretty hard to get them running most of the time."]},{"l":"Remote Process Injection","p":["Remote Process Injection is quiet different from the Local Process Injection.

Its anti-exploit protection is impressive. Of course, highly sophisticated threat actors won't use these simple methods, but at least it can prevent skiddies.","To be honest, I was scared to see these samples in action. Rust's ability to bypass static analysis and even behavior analysis against Windows Defender is really impressive. I suggest you to install a better antivirus program such as Avast, Norton, etc. and also avoid running untrusted programs. On top of that, use a Firewall as well for better protection.","Simplewall Firewall","Thank you for taking the time to read my article.
